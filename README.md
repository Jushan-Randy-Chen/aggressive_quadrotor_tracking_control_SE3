### Minimum snap trajectory
The `.m` file implements minimim snap trajectory generation that was first proposed by the seminal paper :

D. Mellinger and V. Kumar, “Minimum snap trajectory generation
and control for quadrotors,” in 2011 IEEE International Conference
on Robotics and Automation, pp. 2520–2525, 2011.

### Aggressive quadrotor tracking control
The Simulink file implements the entire cascaded incremental dynamic inversion framework proposed in the following paper:

E. Tal and S. Karaman, “Accurate tracking of aggressive quadrotor
trajectories using incremental nonlinear dynamic inversion and differ-
ential flatness,” IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology,
vol. 29, no. 3, pp. 1203–1218, 2021
